# GAID: Generative Adversarial Irregularity Detection

Tensorflow implementation of [GAID](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Ske2oyiye4)

This model detect irregular part in mammography images, after training GAID with normal dataset.

## Model Description

Recognizing irregular tissues in mammography images can be defined as discovering regions that does not comply with normal (healthy) tissues present in the training set. To this end, we propose a method based on adversarial training composed of two important modules. The first module, denoted by R (Reconstructor), discovers the distribution of the healthy tissues, by learning to reconstruct them. The second module, M (Representation matching), learn to detect if its input is healthy or irregular.
